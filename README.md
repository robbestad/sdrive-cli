# SDRIVE UPLOAD

Add `sdriveupload` to /usr/local/bin

Create an API key at `https://sdrive.app/user/api` and get the data for your sdrive.toml.
Place this in your home directory in ./config, eg: /home/yourname/.config/sdrive.toml

Then simply write `sdriveupload <file or folder to upload>` when you want to upload something
